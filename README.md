# Keras-Multiclass-Image-Classification
Build a multi-class image classification application using VGG16 pre-trained deep learning. The dataset is taken from the kaggle repository, source dataset intel : puneet6060/intel-image-classification, in the form of an intel image dataset, consisting of 6 classes, namely buildings, glacier, mountain, forest, sea, and street. Classification is done by performing bottleneck feature extraction and finetuning to get the best accuracy results with the right predictions. The classification results obtained on training accuracy of 98.59%, validation accuracy of 92.09% and test accuracy of 95%. I created this application where the entire process and visualization use the Plotly Dash framework, HTML, and CSS.

Build a multi-class image classification application using InceptionResNetV2 pre-trained deep learning. The dataset is taken from the kaggle repository, source dataset apparel : trolukovich/apparel-images-dataset, in the form of an apparel image dataset, consisting of 5 classes, namely dress, pants, shirt, shoes, and shorts. The classification results obtained on training accuracy of 96.90%, validation accuracy of 97.03% and test accuracy of 98%. I created this application where the entire process and visualization use the Plotly Dash framework, HTML, and CSS.
